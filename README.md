Reverse It - Endpoint
In this program we must reverse user input

Peer review:Jovann Contreras: Code looks good I did it a similar way I am able to inpt a string and a number and they get reversed. There are no problems and everything looks good and runs good.

INSTRUCTIONS
Before anything, open the code in VSCode and run/debug the code. This should lead to a new tab opening, labelled localhost. Copy and paste the URL from that new tab, into the Postman "GET" area. Then, add to the end of the URL like this:
https://localhost:xxxx/Reverse/String/x
The xxxx should be the 4-digit number individual to your computer. Then you wil have /Reverse/String, and in the next space I have labelled with x, you may enter anything you want. Then, hit "Send". The text should show whatever you entered, now reversed.
